Hi Don,

Just do "addpath(genpath(pwd))" in the folder where you put these files and it should work...if not, let me know!

Now the command is something like "csd_wbt('C:\some_folder\parameter_file.txt')".
There might be some additional checks regarding the use of multi-core CPU machines, but should not cause any problems...


Cheers,
Alexander
