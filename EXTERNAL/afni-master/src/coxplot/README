When rebuilding .c files from .f, the struct variable declarations should
be prepended with 'extern', particularly for systems for which -fcommon is
not the default.  The actual struct definitions (with and without extern)
are now in coxplot.h, and are defined in libcoxplot via ppak_commons.c.

When running f2c, check a diff with the previous c file(s).
