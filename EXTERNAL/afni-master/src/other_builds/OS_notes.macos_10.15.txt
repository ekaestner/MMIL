# Notes for building AFNI on Mac OS 10.15, using this makefile:
# Makefile.macos_10.15_clang
# 
# Typesetting what DRG hath wrought.

# UPDATE your Xquartz version to be at least 2.8.0_beta4.
# + this appears to be necessary for SUMA to work (AFNI worked fine at 2.7.11)

# INSTALL the following with homebrew (for gcc, ver=10 is used here by
# default, though actually at the moment 'gcc' is just Mac's clang):

  brew update
  brew install  libpng jpeg expat freetype fontconfig openmotif libomp \
                libxt gsl glib pkg-config gcc mesa mesa-glu libxpm

# LINK the following, but note that:
# + many of these existed already on my machine
# + many of these are version dependent, and so must be searched for.
# We might end up scripting some of this...
#
# These existed already on my computer:
# 
#   ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/gsl/2.6/lib/libgsl.25.dylib                 \
#         /usr/local/lib/libgsl.dylib  
#   ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/openmotif/2.3.8_1/lib/libXm.4.dylib         \
#         /usr/local/lib/libXm.4.dylib
#   # if XQuartz doesn't include libXm (as it used to), then use this:
#   ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/openmotif/2.3.8_1/lib/libXm.a               \
#         /usr/local/lib/libXm.a
#   ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/jpeg/9d/lib/libjpeg.a                       \
#         /usr/local/lib/libjpeg.a
# 
# ... and these I did make (though with a different path for the 
# *netpbm* one:
#
#   ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/jpeg/9d/lib/libjpeg.a                       \
#         /usr/local/lib/libjpeg.9.a
#   ln -s /usr/local/Cellar/netpbm/10.86.18/include/netpbm/pgm.h        \
#         /usr/local/include/pgm.h

# NOTE: DRG removed libbz2.dylib from the installed dylib list because
# it doesn't seem to be used below, but on 10.15 with brew install
# there is /usr/lib/libbz2.1.0.dylib

# After those installs+linking, I was able to build on my Mac by
# copying the appropriate Makefile:
# 
#   cp Makefile.macos_10.15_clang Makefile
# 
# ... and then firing off the make:
#
#   make vastness
