Use exactly the same format as above and make sure paths do not contain any white space.
The info above corresponds with the following parameters (the order is important of course):

1.  Input file name (full path) of *.nii file (4D format with all the non-DW images in the beginning).
2.  Input file name (full path) of *.txt file of the gradient directions (3 column format).
3.  Output folder name (if it does not exist it will be created).
4.  Number of non-DW images.
5.  b-value (in s/mm^2).
6.  Seed point sampling in x, y, and z direction (in mm).
7.  Step size (in mm).
8.  FOD threshold.
9.  Angle deviation threshold.
10. Fiber length range (in mm).
11. Maximum order (even integers).
12. Minimal FA to determine response function.
